Links visited:

http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-number-of-islands/1

key points:

1) In undirected graphs, either Breadth First Search or Depth First Search can be used to detect cycle. In directed graph, only depth first search can be used.

key points:

i) 0-1 BFS

This type of BFS is used to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a graph provided that the edges in the graph have the weights 0 or 1

https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort    Good one

key points:

- Since a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible height - a heap with N nodes always has O(log N) height.
- A heap is useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority. A common use of a heap is to implement a priority queue
- HEAP SORT has O(nlogn) time complexity  for  all the cases ( best case, average case and worst case).

How to build the heap?
Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom up order

Insert
The worst-case runtime of the algorithm is O(log n), since we need at most one swap on each level of a heap on the path from the inserted node to the root.

DeleteMin
The minimum element can be found at the root, which is the first element of the array. We remove the root and replace it with the last element of the heap and then restore the heap property by percolating down. Similar to insertion, the worst-case runtime is O(log n).

3) DFS Vs BFS

The most important points is:-

- BFS starts visiting nodes from root while DFS starts visiting nodes from leaves.
- So if our problem is to search something that is more likely to closer to root, we would prefer BFS. And if the target node is close to a leaf, we would prefer DFS.
